## Title Slide

`@script`
Hello and welcome to the course, here you will be learning about the 3rd normal form and how does it affect the database design.


---
## What we have achieved with 2nd form

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "d87ea31400"
```

`@part1`
Once a table is in second normal form, we are guaranteed:

- All columns in our table are holding atomic values
- All columns in our table are dependent on primary key


`@part2`
What is then wrong with following table?

`@script`
With a second form we have achieved that the table serves a single purpose through the atomic values and dependency of columns on the primary key. But what about relationships among the columns?  Could there be dependencies between columns that could cause a data inconsistency?

Lets have a look on the example of a Person, what could go wrong here if we would create such a table in a database?

## What is a dependency?

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "460a035015"
```

`@part1`
The word dependency in database world means, that the value can be derived from the other:

- Birth day X Age
- Car Model X Manufacturer
- Author X Nationality
- Job position X Salary


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5002/datasets/c41806671850fb4a5936e811a9fb9e32b307d61d/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202019-05-13%20v%C2%A017.25.09.png)

Such dependency **BodyMassIndex** X **IsOverweight** is creating a chance for inconsistency


`@script`
Before we answer this question we have to understand the term dependency. When we say that a column has a dependence on another column, we mean that the value can be derived from the other like my Age can be derived from the information of my birth day. If we would leave this dependency unmaintained we would risk that some one will create different Age value for the same Birth day. The same is true for the other examples with Car model, Author and job position


In our example with the Person table clearly attributes BodyMassIndex and isOverweight are dependent on each other because if BodyMassIndex > 25 then we can indicate that given person has an overweight. 
How to handle this dependencies to make our database design more robust?

## Fixing the model

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "4e76c26d32"
```

`@part1`
In order for our model to be in third normal form, we need to remove the dependencies and that means:

1. Remove all attributes from original table that are dependent
2. Create new table and accommodate the identified dependent attributes
3. Link the tables


`@part2`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5002/datasets/cbabf9b8cc3a62409d7a18d2fff7c1e21e517184/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202019-05-13%20v%C2%A017.34.17.png)


`@script`
We need to follow three basic steps:

	1) Remove all the attributes with the identified dependencies fro mthe original table
	2) Create a new table with the attributes where dependency was identified
    3) Create a relation between those two tables to maintain the reference integrity

## How to turn the model into SQL code

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "3d7f4b584a"
```

`@part1`
```SQL
CREATE TABLE BodyMassTable (
  BodyMassID int4 PRIMARY KEY,
  BodyMassIndex numeric(10, 0) NOT NULL,
  IsOverweight boolean NOT NULL
)

CREATE TABLE Person (
  PersonID int4 PRIMARY KEY,
  Name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  Surname varchar(255) NOT NULL
  BodyMassTableBodyMassID int4
  references BodyMassTable(BodyMassID)
)
```


`@script`
Lets have a look on the SQL code that will generate the tables Person and BodyMassTable. Be aware we have to start always with the table which is not referenced by another table - in our case we will start with BodyMassTable first which is the newly created table derived from application of 3rd normal form and contains the attributes BodyMassIndex and IsOverweight originally stored in the table Person

## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "98ac0d859d"
```

`@script`
Now is your turn. Lets practice the gained knowledge and optimize the database design to comply with the 3rd norm requirements
